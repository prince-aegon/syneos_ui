A physical examination showed stable vital signs, stained body skin, stained conjunctival and oral mucosa, swollen joints, and darker old scars on the forehead. The patient could not walk independently. Moreover, the bilateral thoracic size was symmetrical, bilateral breathing was smooth and bilateral fremitus was normal. Auscultation of the lungs revealed slightly weaker breathing sounds in the right lower lung. The systemic lymph nodes were normal. Auxiliary lung CT showed a 3.0×2.0-cm mass in the right lower lobe with irregular edges and burrs, but there was no significant mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography in the right lower lobe lung revealed a high metabolic mass with possible large lumps, 3.0×2.0 cm in size. Cardiac function was rated with a fractional shortening value of 32% (normal range, 25–35%) and an ejection fraction value of 68% (normal range, >50%), while lung function was recorded with a 2.86 l/sec forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; normal range, 80–120 l/sec). There was no significant mediastinal lymph node metastasis. Laboratory tests showed an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 66.5 sec (normal range, 20–40 sec), a prothrombin time of 16.3 sec (normal range, 9–13 sec), a fibrinogen (Fbg) level of 6.34 g/l (normal range, 2–4 g/l), a platelet level of 323×109/l (normal range, 125–250×109/l), an alanine aminotransferase level of 23 U/l (normal range, 10–60 U/l) and 0.80% blood coagulation factor VIII (normal range, 50–150%).
